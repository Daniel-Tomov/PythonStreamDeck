# Example file by Daniel Tomov

# This file is split into two sections: "scenes" and "sources"
# Inside each, there is the name of the scene / source and some attributes
# Each item has an "img" attribute. The image is pulled from the "img" folder
# The images have to be ".png" or ".jpg". Keep in mind that
# the amount of images on a page will vary the loading times
# The quality of the images will also change loading times
